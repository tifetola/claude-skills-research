# Business Context Ingestion

Build a complete account intelligence document before any keyword research begins. The system needs to understand the account — what they sell, who they sell to, what they want to sell more of, and what already works — or it produces keyword output disconnected from commercial reality.

This is not topic research. This is account understanding.

## Invocation

`/business-context <client-domain>`

Example: `/business-context risevision.com`

---

## Step 0 — Input Gathering

Ask the user once, in one message (skip if called from `/topic-research` pipeline):

> "To build the account intelligence document, tell me what you have available. Share anything you have from this list:
>
> 1. **SEO onboarding form** — paste it here.
> 2. **Sales or discovery call transcripts** — paste key sections or the full transcript.
> 3. **Slack or client comms** — paste relevant threads where the client described goals, priorities, or problems.
> 4. **Competitor list** — any competitors the client specifically named? I'll also pull from Ahrefs.
> 5. **Product or positioning docs** — paste or describe.
> 6. **Existing content inventory** — a page list, sitemap URL, or rough description of what exists.
> 7. **Any specific ICPs, verticals, or segments they've explicitly said they want or don't want?**
>
> Paste whatever you have. I'll fetch the website automatically and pull Ahrefs data. Share what you've got and I'll flag what's missing."

Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

## Step 1 — Website Intelligence

Run in parallel using WebFetch:

**A. Homepage**
Fetch `https://<domain>`. Extract:
- What the product is in plain English (not marketing language)
- Core value proposition
- Who it's for (roles, company sizes, industries named)
- Core capabilities highlighted
- Navigation structure — what product areas exist
- Any pricing signals
- Customer logos or case study references

**B. Key internal pages** — pick the most relevant from navigation and run in parallel:
- `/features` or `/product` — exact feature names as the product calls them
- `/pricing` — plan tiers, pricing model, what's in each tier
- `/solutions` or `/use-cases` — named ICP segments and use cases
- `/customers` or `/case-studies` — who buys, what outcomes they achieve
- `/about` — company stage, size, positioning context
- `/integrations` — which tools they connect with (signals buyer stack)
- `/blog` or `/resources` — what content themes they've published

Extract from all pages:
- Exact product and feature names (not paraphrases)
- Exact customer segments named on the site
- The language the product uses for its own outcomes and categories
- Any claims about differentiation

**C. Ahrefs site intelligence** — run in parallel with the web crawl:
- `site-explorer-metrics` — DR, organic traffic, organic keyword count
- `site-explorer-top-pages` (limit: 20) — top pages by traffic to understand what already works
- `site-explorer-organic-keywords` (limit: 50) — current rankings, especially positions 1–20
- `site-explorer-organic-competitors` (limit: 10) — top organic competitors

**D. GSC data (if available):**
- `gsc-keywords` (limit: 50) — what queries are already driving traffic
- `gsc-pages` (limit: 20) — which pages are performing

---

## Step 2 — Process Contextual Sources

Process whatever the user provided in Step 0.

**From call transcripts and onboarding forms, extract:**
- What the client said they want to rank for (stated goals)
- What the client said they want to avoid
- Which competitors came up by name — in what context (fear, aspiration, repeated mention)
- Which product features or differentiators were emphasized
- Which customer segments or ICPs were called out explicitly
- Objections that came up — what did buyers push back on during sales
- Any conversions or wins mentioned — what pages, keywords, or content drove pipeline
- The client's actual business goal (pipeline, brand, specific product line, specific vertical)

**From comms and Slack, extract:**
Any stated priorities, frustrations, requests, or preferences that reveal what the client values and what they're afraid of.

**From positioning and product docs, extract:**
- How the company positions itself against competitors
- Which features they lead with in sales vs. support with
- What customer outcomes they promise
- Any segments they explicitly pursue or avoid

## Step 3 — Synthesize Account Intelligence

Cross-reference everything from Steps 1 and 2. Build and print the Account Intelligence Document in full:

```
## Account Intelligence — [client domain]
Date: [today's date]

### What They Sell
[Plain-English description. What it does. Who uses it. How it works at a high level.]

### Commercial Priorities
[What the client actually wants to sell more of — specific products, plans, ICPs, or verticals. What did they say in calls? What's the commercial focus, distinct from what the website says?]

### ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
[Specific roles, company sizes, industries. Distinguish between who they currently sell to and who they want to sell to — these are often different.]

### Features and Differentiators That Matter Commercially
[The product capabilities that come up in sales, that clients care about, that drive deals. Use exact product names from the site — not paraphrases.]

### Competitor Landscape
[Which competitors come up most. In what context — named in calls, appearing in Ahrefs data, or both? Which are the most commercially significant?]

### Objections and Friction Points
[What comes up as hesitation in sales. "Implementation takes too long." "It's too expensive." "We already tried X." These are content opportunities.]

### What Already Works
[Pages already ranking. Topics with existing traffic. Any content the client flagged as performing. Ahrefs top pages and GSC winners.]

### What They Want to Avoid
[Segments, topics, or positioning they've explicitly ruled out. This shapes every downstream recommendation.]

### Current Organic Authority
- Domain Rating: [X]
- Monthly organic traffic: [X]
- Organic keywords: [X]
- Top organic competitors: [list]
- Ranking strengths: [topic clusters or pages already working]

### Gaps and Flags
[What's missing from the intelligence. What would change the recommendations if known. What to confirm with the client.]
```

After printing, ask: "Does this account picture look right? Anything wrong, missing, or to add before I extract opportunities?"

Wait for confirmation or edits before proceeding.

## Step 4 — Save

Save the Account Intelligence Document to: `./account-intel-[domain]-[date].md`

Print: `Account intelligence saved to [path]`

## Rules

- **Never invent product facts.** Only use what was found on live pages or provided by the user. Flag anything unclear.
- **Pull from transcripts, not just the website.** The website shows what the client wants to project. Transcripts show what's actually happening in sales.
- **Distinguish stated goals from commercial priorities.** A client saying "we want more brand awareness" when they actually need competitor alternative pages is a gap worth naming.
- **Competitors named in calls > competitors Ahrefs suggests.** If a competitor came up in a sales conversation, it's commercially significant regardless of SEO volume.
- **The "what to avoid" section is mandatory.** It prevents the worst downstream recommendations. If nothing was stated, say so explicitly.
