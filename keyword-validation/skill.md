# Keyword Validation

Take extracted opportunity angles and validate them against real search demand using Ahrefs. This is where Ahrefs comes in — not to dictate strategy, but to confirm that a business opportunity maps to actual search behavior.

The output is a keyword candidate pool: validated keywords grouped by opportunity, with volume, KD, and top-ranking domain, ready for SERP qualification.

## Invocation

`/keyword-validation`

Example: runs after `/opportunity-extraction`, or call standalone and paste the opportunity inventory.

---

## Step 0 — Context Check

If called standalone: ask the user to paste the Opportunity Inventory. You need the full list of opportunities with their types, signals, and indicative formats.

If called from `/topic-research`: use the Opportunity Inventory from Phase 2.

---

## Step 1 — Keyword Generation and Validation Per Opportunity

Work through opportunities in priority order (High → Medium → Low). For each opportunity, generate seed keywords based on the opportunity type and context, then validate with Ahrefs.

Run as many Ahrefs calls in parallel as possible.

**For each opportunity, run in parallel:**

**A. Matching terms exploration**
`keywords-explorer-matching-terms` — use 2–3 seeds that represent the core angle of the opportunity.

**B. Related terms**
`keywords-explorer-related-terms` — use the strongest seed from A to surface adjacent keywords you wouldn't have thought of.

**C. Direct keyword validation**
`keywords-explorer-overview` — for specific keywords you're confident about (e.g., "[competitor] alternatives", "[feature name] software"), get exact volume and KD directly.

**D. Competitor keyword gap (for competitor-led opportunities only)**
`site-explorer-organic-keywords` for the named competitor domain (limit: 30) — what are they ranking for that the client isn't? This surfaces proven keywords the client should own.

### Seed patterns by opportunity type

| Opportunity Type | Seed Patterns |
|---|---|
| **Competitor-led** | `[competitor] alternatives`, `alternatives to [competitor]`, `[client] vs [competitor]`, `[competitor] vs [client]`, `best [competitor] alternatives`, `[competitor] competitors` |
| **Objection-led** | `how long does [X] take`, `[product category] migration`, `switching from [competitor]`, `[product category] implementation time`, `[product category] setup`, `[pain] solution` |
| **Feature-led** | `[feature name] software`, `software with [feature]`, `[feature] tool`, `[feature] for [ICP]`, `best [feature] platform` |
| **Use-case-led** | `[product] for [use case]`, `[use case] software`, `[use case] tools`, `best [product category] for [use case]` |
| **Industry-led** | `[product category] for [industry]`, `[industry] [product category] software`, `[industry] [use case] solution`, `best [product] for [industry]` |
| **Pain-led** | `how to [solve the pain]`, `[pain noun] solution`, `[pain] software`, `[problem description] tool`, `[problem] without [pain]` |
| **Winner expansion** | `[existing top keyword] [adjacent modifier]`, `[topic cluster] [related subtopic]`, `[competitor in same cluster]` |

## Step 2 — Filter Keyword Candidates

For each keyword returned by Ahrefs:

**Include if:**
- Global volume ≥ 50/mo
- For named competitor alternatives queries: include at ≥ 20/mo — these are high-intent at any volume
- Intent is clearly commercial or transactional, OR informational but the searcher is plausibly on the buyer journey
- The keyword clearly maps to the originating opportunity

**Exclude if:**
- Volume is 0 with no data — flag it and note it, but don't include in the validated pool
- Intent is navigational (someone searching for a brand directly)
- The keyword is so broad it attracts the wrong audience
- The client already ranks positions 1–5 for this keyword (check against the Ahrefs data from the business context step — these are wins, not opportunities)

**Flag for review if:**
- Volume is 0 but the keyword is strategically important (a new competitor, an emerging feature term)
- KD is 70+ but the opportunity is commercially critical

---

## Step 3 — Organize the Candidate Pool

Group all validated keywords by opportunity. For each keyword record:
- Keyword
- Global monthly volume
- Keyword difficulty (KD)
- Top-ranking domain from Ahrefs
- Opportunity it belongs to
- Opportunity type
- Notes (anything unusual — no data, very low volume but high intent, etc.)

---

## Output

Print a summary first:

```
## Keyword Validation Summary — [client]
Date: [today's date]

**Opportunities validated:** [N]
**Total keyword candidates:** [N]
**By opportunity type:**
- Competitor-led: N keywords across N competitors
- Feature-led: N keywords
- Use-case-led: N keywords
- Industry-led: N keywords
- Objection-led: N keywords
- Pain-led: N keywords
- Winner expansion: N keywords

**High-volume candidates (500+/mo):** [list top 10]
**Low-volume but high-intent:** [list notable ones with a note on why]
**Opportunities with no searchable demand found:** [list — these get flagged for reconsideration]
```

Then print the full candidate pool grouped by opportunity, using the field structure from Step 3.

If called standalone, ask: "Save to file? Default: `./keyword-candidates-[domain]-[date].md`"

---

## Rules

- **Ahrefs validates — it doesn't dictate strategy.** An opportunity with weak search volume isn't automatically dead. A competitor comparison at 80/mo is worth pursuing if the commercial signal is strong. Zero volume on multiple seed attempts is a real signal, not a death sentence.
- **Never invent volume figures.** Every number in the output must come from an Ahrefs API call. If Ahrefs returns no data, say so clearly.
- **Work through all opportunities.** Don't stop after the first few high-volume wins. The full inventory needs validation before SERP qualification begins.
- **Flag missing data.** If Ahrefs returns no data for a keyword category, name it in the output — don't silently omit it.
- **Global volume is the default.** Only use country-specific volume if the client explicitly targets one market.
